# 1. Project Title

### Annimated Map of Average Minimum Wage in Canadian Provinces; 1965-2021
* A map of Canada showing the Canadian provinces average minimum wage beginning in 1965 to 2021 progressing by intensity of color as
minimum wage increases
* created in RStudio with a focus on the **{tmap}** library


# 2. INTRODUCTION

* Incentive
  * the incentive to complete this project was to improve my understanding of
  mapping geospatial data in R, particularly using the **{tmap}** library
  * also improve my understanding of creating projects and version control in R was a close second
  * [tmap documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/tmap.pdf)



# 3. TECHNOLOGIES
* write down the languages used, the libraries and versions
  * Language
    * R version 4.0.5 (2021-03-31)
  * Libraries
    * datapasta 


# 4. LAUNCH
* how to run a project
* does a project have minimum hardware requirements
  * setting up a local environment, link to GitHub pages, deployed application on Heroku
